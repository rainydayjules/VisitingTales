        //Sam; "Oh yeah, I saw Lewis and that woman when I was skateboarding the other day.#$b#Of course, he wasn't happy to see me. I didn’t even crash into them! $1" 
        //Gus: "Diane seems like a nice lady. I wonder what she’s visiting Pelican Town for."
        //Caroline: "Lewis visited the shop with Diane awhile back. She’s very sweet.#$b#But all Pierre could do is point out her fancy jewelry. $2#$b#I just can’t with him, sometimes. $2"
        //Clint: " Lewis came to show Diane my shop the other day.#$b#She has a nice smile, doesn’t she? $1"

        //Lewis 1: And here we are!
        //Lewis 2: This here is the town's library and museum, all made possible by the taxes from our local businesses.#$b#It's been a lot of hard work, but the collection here has become something quite special.
        //Diane 1: That's wonderful to hear. My colleagues have been talking about the rapid growth of the Pelican Town museum’s exhibits. $1
        //Lewis 3: Hehe... Of course, all thanks to the town's excellent management.
        //Lewis 4: Ah, speaking of!
        //Lewis 5: Diane, let me introduce you to @.#$b#He recently took over the farm right by the bus station.^ She recently took over the farm right by the bus station.
        //Diane 2: Lovely to meet you, @. My name is Diane.#$b#Lewis has been giving me a tour of this charming town of yours.#$b#I take it you visit the museum often?

        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 1 Diane 3: Oh, isn't that nice.#$b#I'd love to discuss all the different books and artifacts with you.#$b#If you have the time, of course.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 2 Diane 4: That’s understandable. The life of a farmer must be quite busy.#$b#I’ll have to speak to someone more intimately familiar with the collection.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 2 Lewis 6: We have Gunther, the curator. He’ll be able to answer any questions you have, Diane.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Diane 5: Interesting. What business do you have with the museum?
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Lewis 7: Oh, sometimes @ donates items to the collection.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Diane 6: That's marvelous. @ must be quite familiar with the area then...
        //Lewis 8: Shall we head inside?
        //Diane 9: Of course.
        //Diane 10: Once again, it's a pleasure to meet you @.
